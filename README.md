## Summary
It's a project on stock market prediction for Data Science Boot Camp 2024.
We use historical data from two types of stocks - index funds (ex. Nasdaq Composite) and individual stocks (ex. Apple). We aim to predict the closing stock price one day in the future. For this purpose we propose to use statistical modeling and forecasting based on moving averages to identify trends and seasonality in stock prices as well as extract autocorrelation times. Apart from statistical methods, we also plan to use machine learning techniques based on Long Short-Term Models (LSTM) and compare the predictions of statistical and machine learning methods. 
Our work would be particularly useful for day traders, and so our stakeholders would be financial brokers that offer online day trading services. According to bankrate.com , the best online brokers for day trading in May 2024 are, /n
Fidelity Investments
Interactive Brokers
Charles Schwab
E-trade Financial
